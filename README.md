# Rick And Morty Maze

* This Maze App was build as a part of Advanced Topic In Programming Course, taken in Ben Gurion University, Information System Engineering Faculty.
* The app was built in Java and uses Search Algorithms,Design Patterns,Client-Server programming, Multithreading and JavaFX GUI

## About

- The Maze Generating functuin is based on Prim algorithm
- if the user cant solve the maze,he/she can choose with which Algorithm the App solver will solve the maze.
    * Solution Based on BFS
    * Solution Based on DFS
    * Solution Based on BestFirstSearch
 - Design Patterns Used:
    * Bridge
    * Startegy
    * Observer
    * Factory
  - Multithreading was used to to create and solve mazes concurrently
